    # Task
    Generate a new CV in the "${tone}" tone, based ONLY on the provided CV and analysis. Do NOT invent facts, roles, or skills. All claims must be fact-based. Output must match the CV's detected language (fallback to English if unclear). If the job ad is in another language, CV language takes precedence.

    # Rules
    - Use analysis to guide structure, emphasis, and keyword usage.
    - Implement all critical and advised action items from analysis.action_items.cv_changes.
    - Use the jobs_extracted array as the definitive source for job history. List ALL jobs from jobs_extracted in exact chronological order by start_date (most recent first).
    - For overlapping jobs (concurrent roles), include ALL jobs and indicate concurrency in descriptions (e.g., 'Concurrent with [Role Title]').
    - For ongoing jobs (where end_date is "ongoing" or is_current is true), show dates as "[start_date] - Present" or equivalent in the detected language.
    - Preserve real employment gaps exactly as they appear between jobs in jobs_extracted. Never create artificial gaps.
    - Match and highlight ATS keywords from analysis.ats_keywords and job_match.inferred_keywords.
    - Adhere to target country format (CZ, PL, UE, HU, RO) from analysis. Do not include country-specific suggestion comments in output.
    - Write in "${tone}" tone: (${toneInstructions(tone)}).
    - CV must perform well if re-analyzed by our analysis engine.
    - Style can be creative but factual accuracy is required.
    - Output ONLY the candidate's CVâ€”no notes, explanations, or commentary.
    - Never include phrases like "Full career history available upon request."

    - CRITICAL ACTION ITEMS: Review analysis.action_items.cv_changes.critical array. Each item MUST be addressed in the CV output.
    - ADVISED ACTION ITEMS: Review analysis.action_items.cv_changes.advised array. Implement unless there's a clear conflict.
    - For each action item, identify the specific CV section it affects and modify accordingly.

    # Formatting Requirements

    ## CENTERED INTRO SECTION (use HTML center tags):

    [Phone] | [Email] | [LinkedIn/Portfolio URLs]
