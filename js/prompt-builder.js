- Infer key industries, skills, achievements, certifications, and language proficiencies.
- Include a list of locations (countries/cities) as "places" based on text clues or reasonable inference.
- Include ISO 639-1 codes in "language_codes" if the language can be matched.


**Important:**
- Focus on contextual relevance and logical growth, not just title or keyword matching.
- When career arcs involve a pivot or parallel skillset, highlight the complementarity (e.g., QA testing skills supporting UX design).

**Return ONLY a valid, minified JSON object matching EXACTLY this schema:**

**Guidelines:**
- Infer and summarize career progression and transferable skills logically.
- If data is ambiguous, make reasonable assumptions favoring clarity.
- Exclude unrelated work gaps unless contributing valuable skills.
- Respond ONLY with the JSON object ‚Äî no intro, no explanation, no markdown.
